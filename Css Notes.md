**HTML**
before learn of css we need to know how html works. html  is a _markup language_ that defines the structure of your content in the website, the structure of html consist in elements that are into a open tags and closing tags "<>, </>"

if we wanna put a simply paragraph we can use  the letter p into the tags like the example: 


```
<p>My cat is very grumpy</p>
```

and the output in the webpage is only "my cat is very grumpy " as a paragraph


the structure of this element is 
opening tag: "<p>"" that has the name of the element 
closing tag: "<  /p>"  that say where the element finish
the content: "cat is very grumpy"
